# Blogit - A Rails blogging solution

Blogit lets you add a blog to your Ruby on Rails application in just a few seconds.

_NOTE: Blogit is currently dormant. I'm interested in spending some time to release version 2.0 for modern Rails environments, but development is going slowly due to very limiting time constraints._. If you're interested in helping to update for version 2.0, please get in touch.

## Installation

Add these to your Gemfile

``` ruby
gem "blogit"
# Blogit depends on ActsAsTaggableOn
gem "acts-as-taggable-on"
```

...and run `bundle install` to install the gem.

Next, run:

``` bash
# add an initializer to config/initializers with all of the configuration options
$ rails g blogit:install

# This will add the necessary migrations to your app's db/migrate directory
rake blogit:install:migrations

# You don't need to run this again if you've already done so
rake acts_as_taggable_on_engine:install:migrations

# This will run any pending migrations
rake db:migrate

```

then add the following to your routes.rb file:

``` bash
# config/routes.rb
mount Blogit::Engine => "/blog"
```

Finally, declare which of your models acts as blogger in your app (probably User or Admin).

``` ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base

  blogs

end
```

Go to http://localhost:3000/blog and see your marvelous new blog.


## Batteries included

Blogit provides you with the following features

* An XML Sitemap located at `/blog/posts.xml`
* An RSS feed located at `/blog/posts.rss`
* Internationalization (see the [locales file](config/locales/en.yml) for configurable options)
* Share links (Google+, Twitter & Facebook)
* [Disquss Comments](http://disqus.com)
* Code Syntax Highlighting CSS file (add `*= require pygments` to your app's stylesheet)
* CSS themes

## Modular

We're designing blogit to be as modular as possible, so you can pick and choose the elements you'd like to use.
